# OpenFDA Project

## Overview

This project uses data from the OpenFDA API to understand the impact of certain ingredients in drugs on adverse events reported over a period of five years. We quantify this impact, identify the most influential ingredients, and develop a predictive model for adverse events based on these ingredients.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Small, processed datasets used for analysis and modeling.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis, data cleaning, and modeling.
- `scripts/`: Standalone Python scripts for more complex data processing or modeling tasks.
- `visualizations/`: Output visualizations, Tableau workbooks, or other graphics.
